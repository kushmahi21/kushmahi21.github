<p>Abstract The past two decades have witnessed an increased awareness of the
power of information visualization to bring attention to relevant issues and to
inform audiences. However, the mirror image of that awareness, the study of how
graphs, charts, maps, and diagrams can be used to deceive, has remained within the
boundaries of academic circles in statistics, cartography, and computer science.

<P class="style">This has led

scope of the problem and proposes tweaks in educational programs to overcome it</p>
